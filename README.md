# CRUD-Application - Leave a Movie Review application.

## Full Stack CRUD application that focuses on frameworks, formatting configuration, database operations and version control.

## I wanted to create this project in order to further my understanding with the React framework, MySQL, APIs and using different routes to carry out multiple operations.

## The purpose of this application is to send data that the user enters on the frontend and sends it via Axios to the backend. Ultimately, I wanted to create a basic API that would aid in my learning about them.

## Issues with the project 

### I had major difficulties trying to setup MySQL on my local machine. I Downloaded the latest version of MySQL server (8.0) and eventually realise the library for MySQL wouldn't work and it would work with mySql2 library. I resorted to downloading MySQL server (5.7) where the original mysql library was compatible with the version I had downloaded.

## Frameworks: frontend: React, backend: Express.
